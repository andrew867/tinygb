/*
 * drmfb.h — a plain writable surface on the DRM display, for apps that are
 * not LVGL.
 *
 * TinyGB and fbDOOM both do the same thing: mmap a framebuffer, write pixels
 * into it, and expect the screen to follow. Through /dev/fb0 the last part is
 * fb_deferred_io noticing page faults on a timer, which caps them at about
 * twenty frames a second whatever they do. This is the same shape against the
 * DRM device instead, where telling the driver is explicit and immediate.
 *
 * WHY ONE BUFFER, NOT TWO
 *
 * Double buffering is the usual answer and is wrong for these two. Both draw
 * INCREMENTALLY - TinyGB's scaler skips rows that did not change between
 * frames, and DOOM's status bar is left alone for most of a tick - and with
 * two buffers each is a frame stale, so "unchanged since last frame" becomes
 * false and every skip-optimisation turns into a bug that looks like tearing.
 * One buffer, written in place, keeps both apps' drawing exactly as it was;
 * the tear that costs is real and accepted.
 *
 * WHY ATOMIC AND NOT THE LEGACY CALLS
 *
 * This started on drmModeSetCrtc plus a DIRTYFB damage hint, on the reasoning
 * that the driver declares .fb_create = drm_gem_fb_create_with_dirty and so
 * turns damage into a plane update. Both TinyGB and DOOM were black anyway,
 * for a whole evening, with their sound playing.
 *
 * The bench that proved this driver fast - tools/linux-n31/drmtest.c, 120
 * commits and 120 flip events at sixty-four frames a second - sets the
 * universal-planes and atomic client caps and drives the panel with
 * DRM_IOCTL_MODE_ATOMIC. It never calls SetCrtc, PageFlip or DIRTYFB. That is
 * the one path on this driver with evidence behind it, and the legacy calls
 * were the part chosen by reasoning. So this now does what the bench does:
 * same caps, same properties, same commit, one buffer instead of two.
 *
 * Nothing here is LVGL. display.h is the LVGL equivalent and the two do not
 * share code, because they share no shape: one hands back an lv_display_t and
 * the other hands back a pointer to pixels.
