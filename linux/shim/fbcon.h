/*
 * fbcon.h — sharing the screen with the kernel console.
 *
 * The framebuffer console and the launcher draw to the same pixels, so every
 * kernel message lands on top of the UI. Turning console logging off entirely
 * would be the wrong fix: the console is how a boot that goes wrong is
 * diagnosed, and that has to keep working right up until there is something
 * else on the screen.
 *
 * So the console is only detached, and only once the launcher is ready to draw.
 * Boot logs to it exactly as before. On the way out it is reattached, and the
 * kernel messages from the whole session are still in the ring buffer, so
 * exiting the launcher gives back a working console rather than a blank one.
 *
 * It is also lent back mid-session, for apps that ARE terminal programs. Those
 * draw through the console, so for them the console is not something in the way
 * - it is the display. Lending is separate from restoring because the launcher
 * has to take the screen again afterwards, and needs to remember that it was
 * the one holding it.
 *
 * Only the framebuffer console is touched. A serial console is a different
 * console and keeps everything throughout, which is what you want when the
 * thing you are debugging is the launcher.

 * There is no owner to ask, so this looks: /proc/<pid>/fd for a link to the

 * polled at a couple of hertz, which is nothing next to painting a frame.

 * genuinely holds the device open.
