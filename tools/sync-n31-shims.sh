# Refresh linux/shim/ from a NanoApps checkout, or say how far it has drifted.
#
# The N31 build borrows a few files from the launcher and the NanoApps tree -
# the DRM surface, the console handoff, the touch-panel search, the build
# stamp, the LVGL mirror rule, and the LVGL config the N31 config is based on.
# They are vendored so this repository builds on its own, and they are the
# launcher's to change: fbDOOM and TinyGB both draw through drmfb.c, and a fix
# there wants to reach both. So the copies are refreshed from NanoApps, never
# edited here, and PROVENANCE says which commit they came from.
#
#   tools/sync-n31-shims.sh            diff the copies against $NANOAPPS
#   tools/sync-n31-shims.sh --apply    copy, and rewrite PROVENANCE
#
# NANOAPPS defaults to ../NanoApps beside this repository, or ../.. when this
# repository is the apps/tinygb subtree inside one.
