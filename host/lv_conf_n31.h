/*
 * lv_conf_n31.h — LVGL config for TinyGB on the N31 Linux port.
 *
 * The same base every N31 app uses, so the menu looks like the rest of the
 * device rather than like a second project.
 *
 * Same base as the device build, so the widget set, the fonts and the 32-bit
 * colour depth are identical and the layout is the one already checked in the
 * screenshots. Only the plumbing differs: this target renders to /dev/fb0,
 * which the kernel already exposes at exactly 240x432, 32 bpp.
 *
 * fbdev rather than DRM on purpose. The DRM path needs libdrm and gbm, and
 * this binary has to be fully static against musl to run on a 26 MB initramfs
 * with no shared libraries to speak of. fbdev needs nothing but an ioctl.
